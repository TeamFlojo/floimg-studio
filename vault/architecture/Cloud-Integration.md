# Cloud Integration

> **See also**: [ADR-001: Pure Open-Source Studio](../../floimg-hq/vault/architecture/ADR-001-Pure-Open-Source-Studio.md)

floimg-studio is a **pure open-source, self-hostable** workflow builder. It contains no cloud-specific code, authentication, or usage limits.

## Architecture Principle

**floimg-studio = pure open-source**
**floimg-cloud = commercial extension layer**

This follows the Supabase model where the open-source project is fully functional standalone, and cloud features are added by a separate commercial layer.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

floimg-studio is designed for self-hosting. No special configuration needed:

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/teamflojo/floimg-studio
cd floimg-studio
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Optional Configuration

```env
# AI providers (user provides their own keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-xxx

# Optional content moderation
MODERATION_ENABLED=true
MODERATION_THRESHOLD=0.7
```

## How studio.floimg.com Works

The cloud-hosted version at `studio.floimg.com` is powered by `floimg-cloud`, which:

1. Imports `@floimg-studio/*` packages as dependencies
2. Wraps the editor with cloud-specific features
3. Deploys the extended version

```
floimg-cloud/packages/studio-cloud/
├── src/
│   ├── CloudApp.tsx          # Wraps WorkflowEditor
│   ├── CloudAuthProvider.tsx # Session management
│   ├── UsageLimits.tsx       # Tier-based limits
│   └── CloudToolbar.tsx      # Extended toolbar with user menu
└── package.json              # depends on @floimg-studio/frontend
```

## For Contributors

When contributing to floimg-studio:

- **DO NOT** add authentication code
- **DO NOT** add usage limits or tier checks
- **DO NOT** hardcode floimg.com URLs
- **DO NOT** add analytics tracking
- **DO NOT** add marketing copy or upgrade prompts

If a feature requires cloud infrastructure, it belongs in `floimg-cloud`, not here.
